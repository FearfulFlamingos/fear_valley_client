# FEAR VALLEY
## Introduction
*Fear Valley* is the name of the computer game we have created as our senior project. It is written in C# and implemented with the Unity engine. 

We decided to use the Unity engine for a few reasons:
* Previous familiarty
* Known ease of entry
* Far and away the most popular free game engine for professionals and individuals alike


## Installation
Currently, you can clone this repo and open the project through the Unity hub using version 2018.4.9. We decided to use the latest LTS version of unity. After opening the project, you can build the project using the unity editor.

At this time, we have no precompiled binary installation files.
